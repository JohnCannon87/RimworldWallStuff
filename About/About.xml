	<description><![CDATA[Adds Wall Mountable Items To The Game,
	Items Included:
	Wall Mounted Heater (Same stats as default heater)
	Wall Mounted Cooler (Slightly less powerful vs the standard cooler to offset the lack of need for venting)
	Wall Mounted Climate Controller (Controls temperature around a set value, heating and cooling as needed, uses the power values from the heater and cooler)
	Wall Mounted Flatscreen Television (Same stats as default flatscreen)
	Wall Mounted Replicator (1000W power usage can spawn a specific item(s) once a day, available items can be switched with a button for each replicator (this resets the timer) the list of available items is configurable in the Mod Settings (With thanks to the QuarryMod where I stole most of the saving code from)
	In Wall Vent
	Small Wall Mounted Flatscreen Television (Smaller range than the full size wall mounted but only takes 1 tile, perfect for Hospital entertainment)
	Wall Mounted Trade Beacon (Works same as the vanilla version)
	Wall Mounted Comms Console (Works same as the vanilla version)
	Wall Mounted Battery (1 cell, holds less power than normal battery but more efficient for slightly more steel cost)
	Wall Mounted Tool Board (2 cells, does the same job as a vanilla Tool Cabinet, stuffable to can be made from Wood, Plasteel etc.)
	
	If the RT Fuse mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=728314182) is present:
	Wall Mounted Circuit breaker (1 cell, designed to handle 3 of the wall mounted batteries so slightly less powerful than the default 2 cell version from RT Fuse)

  Power levels of the heater and cooler are also configurable in the mod settings.
